# Yggdrasil

Yggdrasil is an early-stage implementation of a fully end-to-end encrypted IPv6 network. It is lightweight, self-arranging, supported on multiple platforms, and allows pretty much any IPv6-capable application to communicate securely with other Yggdrasil nodes. Yggdrasil does not require you to have IPv6 Internet connectivity - it also works over IPv4. For more information, see our [about](about.md) page.

## Project Status

The project is currently in the alpha stage. You can expect the occasional breaking change and backwards incompatibility, but Yggdrasil is generally stable for day-to-day use.

Yggdrasil is written in Go. The codebase is fairly small and easy to navigate. It has been tested on a number of platforms (including Linux, Windows, macOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Ubiquiti EdgeRouter). See our [developers](developers.md) page for more info.

A small number of users have been using and stress-testing Yggdrasil quite heavily for a variety of use cases. We have a number of [internal services](services.md) available, contributed and operated by the community.
